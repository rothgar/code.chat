# Code.chat

Code chat is an automated podcast for crazy people who like to listen to code.
The premise of code chat is each week a popular code snippet (gist) from GitHub
or similar website will be run through text to speech software and exported to
audio format. Commonly used punctuation will be altered during the text to
speech translation to allow for easier listening.

A short url will also be provided so listeners can go look at the code to figure
out what it does (if not able to by with audio alone.

Links will also be provided via twitter at TBD
